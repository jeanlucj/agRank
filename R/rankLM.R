#' Rank aggregation using linear models
#'
#' Aggregate the ranking from triple comparisons into a consensus ranking using linear models.
#'
#' @param data a n * m matrix,
#' where n is the number of observers and m is the number of items each observer ranked;
#' each row vector is a partial or complete ranking,
#' with i-th element being the rank assigned to item i;
#' the entry where that item is not ranked in the partial ranking is replaced by 0
#' @param K the additive relationship matrix; if provided,
#' use to specify the covariance among item scores
#'
#' @return Return a list with three components:
#'     \item{ranks}{a vector where the i-th element is the rank assigned to the i-th item.}
#'     \item{scores}{a vector of the estimated scores of the varieties.}
#'     \item{scoreVar}{a scalar of the estimated score variance. This variance is method specific.}
